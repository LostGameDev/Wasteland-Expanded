Because i am not the original author of the Wasteland mod i am using the same license as the original
Here's a rundown of what the current license allows you to do:

* You **can** use the mod in modpacks.
* You **cannot** redistribute the mod outside of the official download locations for the mod.
* You **can** decompile the mod and make modifications to the src code for private use or learn from it.

If you're unsure of what you can and can't do after reading this and the license itself, feel free to ask me directly, and i'll be happy
to help.
